# Animal Encyclopedia

This is a Internet Programming web applicaiton project I made using JSON Server as the backend and Next.js as the frontend.

## Features

- Browse detailed information about various animal species
- Learn about scientific names, taxonomy, locations, characteristics and descriptions
- User management system
- Comment system for sharing knowledge and experiences
- Search and sort functionality
- Responsive design for all devices

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deadlyforce16/animal-encyclopedia.git
cd animal-encyclopedia
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. First, start the JSON Server (this runs the backend on port 3001):
```bash
npm run json-server
```

4. Then, in a separate terminal, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
