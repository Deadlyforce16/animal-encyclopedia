# Animal Encyclopedia

This is a Internet Programming web applicaiton project I made using JSON Server as the backend and Next.js as the frontend.

- Learn about animals including scientific names, taxonomy, locations, characteristics and 
descriptions

1. Clone or download the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deadlyforce16/animal-encyclopedia.git

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install

3. First, start the JSON Server (this runs the backend on port 3001):

4. Then, in a separate terminal, run the development server:
